Vs Vue3 Select is a feature rich select/dropdown/typeahead component. It provides a
default template that fits most use cases for a filterable select dropdown. The
component is designed to be as lightweight as possible, while maintaining high
standards for accessibility.

This is a fork of a popular component that has not been maintained for a long time. The component has been enhanced with
additional functionality and will continue to evolve and receive updates.
